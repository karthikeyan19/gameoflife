# gameoflife
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.


Rules for game :

1)Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.<br>
2)Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.<br>
3)Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.<br>
4)Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction


# sudoku 
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

I solved Sudoku using Backprobagation technique.
